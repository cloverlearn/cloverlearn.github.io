Exploring data is a good starting pointing to find out what can be done with the data. Before solving a problem you have to find what problems needs to be solved as we discussed in my previous [post](https://www.cloverlearn.com/needle-in-haystack/ "The Needle in Haystack"). You can have an extensive look at the handbook this post is based on at [here](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/eda.htm "Exploratory Data Analysis"). Here we accompany examples along with ideas presented so that you can understand the tools, techniques and applications used in exploring the data better.

The main objective of Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA) is to summarize the important characteristics of data \[2\]. The output of EDA is mostly presented through various forms of visualizations. The idea is to explore the data or seeing what the data can do for you. 

In this tutorial we use an example
