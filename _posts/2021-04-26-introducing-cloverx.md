Hi everyone, 

Let me introduce our own open-source theme for anyone to use in their Jekyll website. It felt to me that I should make my own theme to cater to my needs of simplicity. This work has been my spare time activity and I hope eveyone can make use of it in the future. Let me know your thoughts about it in the theme repository. 

As always, we make everything we develop open to public and you can find the theme in [GitHub](https://github.com/cloverlearn/cloverx).
