Many companies collect large amounts of data to provide better services to the users. But, is all of that data is equally important to be useful? Well, sometimes not so much... Most of the data may not be relevant to a cause that we need to pursue. Let's take an example: There are large amounts of Tweets related to natural disasters posted by people. However, a very less number of Tweets are relevant to disaster and response management. But the problem is how do we select what matters most?

What matters the most depends on the problem that you are trying to solve. Once you know the right question to ask, you can apply existing tools and techniques on the data to answer those questions \[1\].

We will learn more about techniques and tools in my future tutorials. Here, I will just extend my earlier example. The problem of identifying relevant tweets for disasters is a hard task. Most of the time datasets that are labeled on a new disaster crisis are unavailable at the time of the crisis. The unavailability of the dataset can hinder the problem-solving process. Data from past events may not be useful without advanced modeling techniques due to problems like concept drift \[2\]. In addition, the dataset labeled on one kind of disaster may not be directly related to another disaster. For example, previous datasets on hurricanes are mostly not related to answering questions on COVID-19.

Finding what matters from data is an evolving process that is different from one task to another and one domain to another. Identifying the problem, collecting the relevant data, application of tools and techniques, and delivering the results are parts of the process that needs to be understood thoroughly to provide solutions that benefits whole humanity.
